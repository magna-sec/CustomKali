# CustomKali
Makes Kali less urgghhh tacky and more hacky

This Does:
- Install various Windows + Linux tools
- Replaces the terrible bashrc
- New wallpaper (though u still need to set it(its probably also not to your taste))
- Just overall makes Kali look less tacky

This repo will probably become a dumping ground for "DON'T FORGET THAT GITHUB"
